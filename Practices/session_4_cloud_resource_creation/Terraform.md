[Install Google Cloud SDK](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/install). The instructions are available for Windows, Mac and Linux.

## Introduction

In this practice we will learn the basics of Terraform, focusing on basic Terraform commands, the syntax of HCL and local resources. We will also learn how to use modules and how to manage state.

## Practice

### Infrastructure as Code (IaC)

Infrastructure as Code (IaC) is a practice of managing and provisioning infrastructure resources using code, instead of manually configuring them. IaC provides a more efficient, consistent, and reproducible way of managing infrastructure, reducing the risk of human error and increasing scalability.

With Terraform, you can define your infrastructure as code, and version it like any other software code. This way, you can easily share, collaborate, and maintain your infrastructure, enabling teams to quickly and safely provision and manage cloud resources across multiple environments.

#### Exercise

To get started with Terraform, let's create a simple IaC example. Create a new directory and a file named `main.tf` inside it. Copy and paste the following code:

```arduino
provider "local" {}

resource "local_file" "example" {
  content  = "Hello, Terraform!"
  filename = "example.txt"
}
```

This code defines a local provider, which is used to create local resources, and a `local_file` resource that creates a new file named `example.txt` in the current directory with the content "Hello, Terraform!".

Now, open a terminal in the directory where the `main.tf` file is located and run `terraform init` to initialize the Terraform working directory. After that, run `terraform apply` to create the local file. You should see an output like this:

```log
local_file.example: Creating...
local_file.example: Creation complete after 0s [id=example.txt]

Apply complete! Resources: 1 added, 0 changed, 0 destroyed.
```

Check that the file was created with the following command: `cat example.txt`. The output should be `Hello, Terraform!`.

Finally, run `terraform destroy` to destroy the local file. You should see an output like this:

```log
local_file.example: Destroying... [id=example.txt]
local_file.example: Destruction complete after 0s

Destroy complete! Resources: 1 destroyed.
```

### HashiCorp Configuration Language (HCL)

The HashiCorp Configuration Language (HCL) is a declarative language used to define infrastructure resources in Terraform. It is designed to be easy to read and write, and to be compatible with JSON.

Here are some of the main features of HCL:

1. Resources: Resources are the fundamental building blocks of Terraform configurations. They represent the infrastructure components you want to create and manage. Each resource block declares a single resource and specifies its attributes.

Exercise:
Create a resource block for a local file that defines the content, filename, and file permissions. Use the following code as a reference:

```arduino
resource "local_file" "example" {
  content  = "Hello, Terraform!"
  filename = "example.txt"
  file_permission = "0644"
}
```

2. Variables: Variables allow you to parameterize your configurations and pass in values at runtime. They can be defined within a configuration file, or in a separate variable file.

Here we explore the different ways to create and pass variables to Terraform:

   1. Variable declaration in Terraform configuration files: In Terraform, you can declare variables directly in your configuration files using the `variable` block. This allows you to define variables that are specific to your infrastructure and use them throughout your configuration files. Here's an example:


  ```arduino

variable filename {
    type = string 
    default = "sample.txt"
}


variable content{
    type = string
    default = "I love terraform"
}

resource local_file sample_res {
  filename             = var.filename
  content              = var.content
}
  ```

  2. Command line flags: You can pass variables to Terraform at runtime using the `-var` flag followed by the variable name and value. This is useful when you want to override a variable value defined in your configuration file. For example:

  ```arduino
  terraform apply -var="filename=sample2.txt"
  ```

   3. Environment variables: You can also set variables using environment variables. Terraform will look for environment variables with a specific prefix (`TF_VAR_` by default) and use their values as variable values. For example:

  ```arduino
  export TF_VAR_filename=sample3.txt
  terraform apply
  ```

   4. Variable files: Variable files allow you to define variables in a separate file, which can be shared across multiple Terraform configurations. This can be useful for defining variables that are used across different environments or projects. Here's an example of a variable file:

  ```arduino
  filename = "sample3.txt"
  content = "I love Terraform"
  ```

  You can load variable files using the `-var-file` flag followed by the path to the file. For example:

  ```arduino
  terraform apply -var-file="vars.tfvars"
  ```

Exercise:
Create a variable using each of the methods described above. Declare a variable in a configuration file, override it using a command line flag, set it using an environment variable, and load it from a variable file. Use the `filename` variable as an example. Define it as "my_file1" in the configuration file, override it with "my_file2" using a command line flag, set it to "my_file3" using an environment variable, and load it from a variable file named `vars.tfvars`.


3. Dependencies: Dependencies allow you to define relationships between resources, specifying the order in which they should be created or destroyed.

Exercise:
Create a dependency between two local files. The first file should be created before the second file. Use the following code as a reference:

```arduino
resource "local_file" "file1" {
  content  = "This is file 1"
  filename = "file1.txt"
}

resource "local_file" "file2" {
  content  = "This is file 2"
  filename = "file2.txt"
  depends_on = [
    local_file.file1
  ]
}
```


4. Lifecycle: The lifecycle argument allows you to specify certain configuration behaviors that occur during the lifecycle of a resource, such as creating, updating, or destroying it.

The `lifecycle` argument is used to control when certain operations are performed on a resource. There are several lifecycle sub-arguments that you can use to customize the behavior of a resource:

   1. `create_before_destroy`: This sub-argument controls whether the resource should be created before the old resource is destroyed. This is useful when you want to avoid downtime by ensuring that the new resource is available before the old one is removed.

   Example:

   ```arduino
   resource "local_file" "sampleFile" {
        content     = "Hello world!"
        filename = "./sample4.txt"
        lifecycle {
            create_before_destroy = true
        }
    }

   ```

   Exercise:

   Create a local file, and use the `create_before_destroy` lifecycle sub-argument to ensure that the new file is created before the old one is destroyed.

   2. `prevent_destroy`: This sub-argument controls whether the resource can be destroyed. This is useful when you want to prevent accidental deletion of an important resource.

   Example:

   ```arduino
   resource "local_file" "sampleFile2" {
        content     = "Hello world!"
        filename = "./sample5.txt"

        lifecycle {
            prevent_destroy = true
        }
    }

   ```

   Exercise:

   Create a local file with Terraform, and use the `prevent_destroy` lifecycle sub-argument to prevent accidental deletion of the local file.

   3. `ignore_changes`: This sub-argument controls which attributes of the resource should be ignored when determining whether the resource needs to be updated. This is useful when you have attributes that change frequently but don't affect the behavior of the resource.

   Example:

   ```arduino
    resource "local_file" "sampleFile3" {
        content     = "Hello world!"
        filename = "./sample6.txt"

        lifecycle {
            ignore_changes = [content]
        }
    }

   ```

   Exercise:

   Create a local file with Terraform, and use the `ignore_changes` lifecycle sub-argument to ignore changes to the file name, and content attributes.

   4. `prevent_replacement`: This sub-argument controls whether the resource can be replaced. This is useful when you have a resource that is critical and should never be replaced.

   Example:

   ```arduino
    resource "local_file" "sampleFile4" {
        content     = "Hello world!"
        filename = "./sample7.txt"

        lifecycle {
            prevent_replacement = true
        }
    }

   ```

  

   5. `create_before_destroy_max_wait`: This sub-argument controls the maximum amount of time that Terraform will wait for the new resource to become available before giving up and destroying the old resource. This is useful when you have a long-running resource that can't be recreated quickly.

   Example:

   ```arduino

    resource "local_file" "sampleFile5" {
        content     = "Hello world!"
        filename = "./sample8.txt"

        lifecycle {
            create_before_destroy = true
            create_before_destroy_max_wait = 600
        }
    }

   ```

  

5. Meta arguments: Meta-arguments are arguments that are applied to a resource or module block, rather than to a specific attribute.

Exercise:
Add a meta-argument to the `local_file` resource that specifies the resource mode. Use the following code as a reference:

```arduino
resource "local_file" "example" {
  content  = var.file_content
  filename = "example.txt"
  file_permission = "0644"

  meta-argument "mode" {
    type = string
    default = "0666"
  }
}
```



### HCL Data Types

Sure, here are some of the data types and data structures that Terraform supports:

1. String: A sequence of characters. Example: `"Hello, world!"`

2. Number: An integer or a floating-point number. Example: `42` or `3.14`

3. Boolean: A value that is either true or false. Example: `true`

4. List: An ordered sequence of values of the same type. Example: `[ "apple", "banana", "cherry" ]`

5. Tuple: An ordered sequence of values of different types. Example: `["John", "Doe", 42]`

6. Map: A collection of key-value pairs, where the keys are strings and the values can be of any type. Example: `{ name = "John", age = 42 }`

7. Object: An unordered collection of attributes, where each attribute is a key-value pair. Example: `{ name = "John", age = 42 }`

8. Set: An unordered collection of unique values of the same type. Example: `["apple", "banana", "cherry"]`

Here are some examples of how you might use these data types and structures in Terraform:

```arduino
variable "greeting" {
  type = string
  default = "Hello, world!"
}

variable "count" {
  type = number
  default = 3
}

variable "is_enabled" {
  type = bool
  default = true
}

variable "fruits" {
  type = list(string)
  default = [ "apple", "banana", "cherry" ]
}

variable "person" {
  type = tuple([string, string, number])
  default = ["John", "Doe", 42]
}

variable "person_details" {
  type = map(any)
  default = {
    name = "John"
    age = 42
  }
}

variable "users" {
  type = set(string)
  default = ["alice", "bob", "charlie"]
}

variable "config" {
  type = object({
    name = string,
    age = number,
    fruits = list(string),
  })
  default = {
    name = "John",
    age = 42,
    fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"],
  }
}
```

In this example, we've defined several variables, each with a different data type. The `greeting` variable is a string, the `count` variable is a number, the `is_enabled` variable is a boolean, the `fruits` variable is a list of strings, the `person` variable is a tuple containing a string, a string, and a number, the `person_details` variable is a map with two keys, `name` and `age`, both of which have a different data type, the `users` variable is a set of strings, and the `config` variable is an object with three keys, `name`, `age`, and `fruits`.

### HCL: Count and For Each

The `count` and `for_each` arguments in Terraform allow you to create multiple instances of a resource with different configurations.

The `count` argument creates multiple instances of a resource based on a single configuration block. It takes a number as input and creates that many instances of the resource. The instances are numbered starting from 0 and can be accessed using the `element` function.

Example:

```arduino
resource "local_file" "example" {
  count    = 3
  filename = "/tmp/example${count.index}.txt"
  content  = "example"
}
```

This will create three instances of the `local_file` resource, with filenames `/tmp/example0.txt`, `/tmp/example1.txt`, and `/tmp/example2.txt`.

The `for_each` argument creates multiple instances of a resource based on a map or set of maps. It takes a map as input, where each key corresponds to a unique identifier for the resource, and the value is a map containing the configuration for that resource. The instances can be accessed using the `each` object.

Example:

```arduino
variable "example_files" {
  type = map(object({
    filename = string
    content  = string
  }))
  default = {
    example1 = {
      filename = "/tmp/example1.txt"
      content  = "example1"
    }
    example2 = {
      filename = "/tmp/example2.txt"
      content  = "example2"
    }
  }
}

resource "local_file" "example" {
  for_each = var.example_files
  filename = each.value.filename
  content  = each.value.content
}
```

This will create two instances of the `local_file` resource, one with filename `/tmp/example1.txt` and content `example1`, and the other with filename `/tmp/example2.txt` and content `example2`.

Exercise:

Create two local file resources in Terraform, one using `count` and the other using `for_each`. Use different filenames and content for each instance.



## Providers

Providers are plugins in Terraform that allow you to interact with various infrastructure platforms or services. Providers allow Terraform to manage resources on different cloud providers or services in a uniform way. Providers can be official or community-maintained and are typically distributed as separate binary plugins. In order to include a provider for the first time, it has to be included in your prject.


To use a provider in your Terraform configuration, you need to declare it using the `provider` block. The `provider` block contains the name of the provider, its version, and any configuration parameters that are required.

Example:

```arduino
terraform {
  required_providers {
    google = {
      source  = "hashicorp/google"
      version = "4.69.1"
    }
  }
}
```

This declares the `google` provider.

Once the provider is declared, you can use the resources and data sources defined by that provider in your Terraform configuration.

Providers can also be used to manage multiple environments or accounts. You can create multiple provider blocks with different configuration parameters to manage different environments or accounts.


### GCP Provider



1. `GCS`: 

Google Cloud Storage (GCS) buckets are  basic containers where users can upload any amount of data, in any format. Data stored in GCS buckets are organized into objects which are essentially the individual pieces of data that you upload to your bucket. GCS buckets provide high-capacity, durable, and scalable storage suitable for a wide range of use cases, including serving website content, storing data for archival and disaster recovery, or distributing large data objects to users via direct download. They can be configured with different storage classes to optimize cost-efficiency based on the frequency and speed of data access needed.

```arduino
# Adding the providers to the project
terraform {
  required_providers {
    google = {
      source  = "hashicorp/google"
      version = "4.69.1"
    }
  }
}

# Adding the provider configuration
provider "google" {
  # Configuration options
  project = "terraform-gcp-project-389602"
  region  = "us-east1"
  zone    = "us-east1-b"
}

#name of the bucket has to be globally unique
resource "google_storage_bucket" "GCS1" {
  name = "my-test-bucket-1221"
  location      = "US"
  storage_class = "STANDARD"
}
```

This Terraform script deploys a Google Cloud Storage (GCS) bucket in Google Cloud Platform (GCP). It first specifies the Google provider, obtained from HashiCorp and using version 4.69.1, then sets the GCP project, region, and zone to which resources will be deployed. The script creates a GCS bucket named "my-test-bucket-1221" in the 'US' location with a 'STANDARD' storage class. It's crucial to note that the bucket name must be globally unique across all existing bucket names in Google Cloud Storage.

2. `GCP Big Query`:

Google BigQuery is a fully-managed, serverless data warehouse solution provided by Google Cloud Platform (GCP). It enables super-fast SQL queries using the processing power of Google's infrastructure. BigQuery allows you to analyze large datasets in real time by running SQL-like queries on structured and semi-structured data. It can handle billions of rows, making it a great choice for big data analytics. It also integrates well with popular data processing frameworks like Apache Beam and Apache Spark. Through its ability to execute SQL queries over vast amounts of data in a matter of seconds, BigQuery enables businesses to gain real-time insights and make data-driven decisions promptly.

```arduino
resource "google_bigquery_dataset" "bd_ds" {
  dataset_id = "ds_from_tf"
}

resource "google_bigquery_table" "table_tf" {
  table_id = "table_from_tf"
  dataset_id = google_bigquery_dataset.bd_ds.dataset_id

}
```

This Terraform script sets up a BigQuery dataset and a table within it on Google Cloud Platform. The resource block then creates a BigQuery table within this dataset, with the table ID 'table_from_tf'. The 'dataset_id' argument is set to the ID of the previously created dataset.

3. `GCP Big Table`:

Google Cloud Bigtable, is a NoSQL big data database service. It's designed to handle massive workloads at consistent low latency and high throughput, making it ideal for running high-performance applications and analytics on large volumes of single-keyed data. Bigtable shines when used for applications like real-time analytics, IoT data processing, and machine learning. As a managed service, Bigtable eliminates much of the administrative overhead involved in maintaining such a high-performance database system. It is also designed to seamlessly integrate with popular big data tools like Hadoop and Dataflow, and it's the underlying storage mechanism for several Google services like Search, Analytics, and Gmail.

```arduino
resource "google_bigtable_instance" "bt-from-tf" {
  
  name = "bt-from-tf"
  deletion_protection = false
  labels = {
    "env" = "testing"
  }
  cluster {
    cluster_id = "bt-from-tf-1"
    num_nodes = 1
    storage_type = "SSD"
  }

}


resource "google_bigtable_table" "tb1" {
  name = "tb-from-tf"
  instance_name = google_bigtable_instance.bt-from-tf.name
}
```

This Terraform script creates a Google Bigtable instance and a table within that instance. The google_bigtable_instance resource block defines a Bigtable instance named 'bt-from-tf' with 'deletion_protection' set to false, meaning it can be deleted without a confirmation prompt. It also assigns a label 'env' with the value 'testing'. The instance consists of a single cluster with an ID of 'bt-from-tf-1', using SSD storage and containing one node. The google_bigtable_table resource block then creates a table named 'tb-from-tf' within the previously defined Bigtable instance. The 'instance_name' argument refers to the name of the Bigtable instance created in the previous resource block.


4. `GCP Pub Sub`:

Google Cloud Pub/Sub is a robust, scalable, real-time messaging service that allows for secure and highly available communication between independently written applications. It follows the publisher-subscriber pattern, enabling the decoupling of sender (publisher) and receiver (subscriber) applications. Publishers send messages to topics, and subscribers receive those messages via subscriptions, which can either 'pull' messages or have them 'pushed' to a configured endpoint. Google Pub/Sub is globally distributed and can automatically scale as the need arises, making it a great solution for building event-driven systems and IoT applications, implementing microservices communication, or handling data streaming for analytics.

```arduino
resource "google_pubsub_topic" "topic_tf" {
  name = "topic_tf"
}

resource "google_pubsub_subscription" "sub_tf" {
  name = "sub_tf"
  topic = google_pubsub_topic.topic_tf.name
}
```

This Terraform script is used to set up a Google Cloud Pub/Sub system with a topic and a subscription. The google_pubsub_topic resource block creates a Pub/Sub topic named 'topic_tf'. Then, the google_pubsub_subscription resource block sets up a subscription named 'sub_tf' for that topic. In Pub/Sub, a publisher application creates and sends messages to a topic, and subscriber applications create a subscription to a topic to receive those messages. Here, the 'topic' argument in the subscription block is set to the name of the previously created topic, linking the subscription to the topic.

### Versioning constraints

Terraform provides several ways to specify version constraints for providers and modules.

For providers, you can specify version constraints in the `required_providers` block of your Terraform configuration. There are several ways to specify version constraints:

- `version` constraint: This allows you to specify a single version or range of versions for the provider.

Example:

```arduino
terraform {
  required_providers {
    google = {
      source  = "hashicorp/google"
      version = ">= 4.69.1, < 5.0.0"
    }
  }
}
```

The reason for using a range of versions is that you might want your configuration to benefit from provider updates, but still restrict to versions that are known to be compatible with your configuration

- `source` constraint: This allows you to specify a specific provider release by its source URL.

This will require the latest release of the `google` provider from the HashiCorp registry.

For modules, you can specify version constraints in the `module` block of your Terraform configuration. There are several ways to specify version constraints:

- `version` constraint: This allows you to specify a single version or range of versions for the module.

Example:


```arduino
module "example" {
  source  = "hashicorp/google"
  version = "~> 4.0"
}
```

This will use version 4.x of the `hashicorp/google` module.

- `source` constraint: This allows you to specify a specific module release by its source URL.



Exercise:

Declare a required provider block for the `google` provider with a version constraint that requires version 3.0 or later. 

When specifying version constraints in Terraform, you can use several operators to specify the version range you need. The most commonly used operators are:

- `=`: Specifies an exact version. For example, `version = "1.2.3"`.

- `>=`: Specifies that any version greater than or equal to the specified version is acceptable. For example, `version >= "1.2.0"`.

- `<=`: Specifies that any version less than or equal to the specified version is acceptable. For example, `version <= "1.2.0"`.

- `~>`: Specifies that any version greater than or equal to the specified version, but less than the next major version is acceptable. For example, `version ~> "1.2"` will allow any version between `1.2` and `2.0` (excluding `2.0`).

- `~`: Specifies that any version greater than or equal to the specified version, but less than the next minor version is acceptable. For example, `version ~ "1.2"` will allow any version between `1.2` and `1.3` (excluding `1.3`).

- `!=`: Specifies that any version that does not match the specified version is acceptable. For example, `version != "1.2.0"`.

Example:

```arduino
terraform {
  required_providers {
    google = {
      source  = "hashicorp/google"
      version = "~> 4.0"
    }
  }
}

module "network" {
  source  = "terraform-google-modules/network/google"
  version = ">= 2.0, < 3.0"
}
```

In this example, the `required_providers` block specifies that any version greater than or equal to 3.0, but less than 4.0, of the `google` provider is acceptable.

The `module` block is used to include the network module from the Terraform Google modules collection. The version constraint ">= 2.0, < 3.0" specifies that you want to use any 2.x version of this module.


### State, state locking, and remote state

In Terraform, the state refers to a file that contains all the information about the resources that Terraform is managing. This file is created after the execution of the `terraform apply` command and is used to track the current state of the infrastructure. 

The state file is an important artifact that Terraform uses to manage the infrastructure. Without it, Terraform would not be able to know which resources are currently deployed, what their current configuration is, and what changes need to be applied when executing a new plan. 

State locking is a mechanism used to prevent concurrent access to the state file. When you execute a Terraform command that needs to access the state file, such as `terraform apply`, Terraform will lock the file to prevent other processes or users from modifying it at the same time. State locking is important to prevent data corruption and conflicts that can arise when multiple users try to modify the same infrastructure at the same time.

Remote state is a mechanism that allows Terraform to store the state file remotely. This means that the state file is not stored locally on your machine but instead in a remote storage system. The most commonly used remote state storage options are Amazon S3, Google Cloud Storage, and HashiCorp's Terraform Cloud.

Using remote state has several advantages. First, it allows multiple users to collaborate on the same infrastructure by sharing the same state file. Second, it provides an additional layer of security by encrypting the state file at rest. Third, it enables the state file to be versioned and backed up.

To use remote state in Terraform, you need to configure a remote backend. This can be done in the `terraform` block of your configuration file. Here is an example:

```arduino
terraform {
  backend "gcs" {
    bucket  = "my-terraform-state"
    prefix  = "terraform/state"
  }
}
```

Here is an example of how you can configure the Google Cloud Storage (GCS) backend in Terraform to store the state file in a GCS bucket. The bucket name here is "my-terraform-state", and the "prefix" argument is used to specify the name of the state file.

### Modules

Terraform modules are reusable collections of Terraform resources that can be shared and versioned independently. Modules help to organize Terraform code, make it more reusable, and reduce duplication.

A Terraform module consists of one or more .tf files that define a set of resources, variables, outputs, and other configuration elements. Modules can be used to represent infrastructure components such as a Compute Engine instance, a Cloud SQL database cluster, or a Cloud Load Balancer in Google Cloud Platform (GCP).

Modules can be stored in a variety of locations, including a local directory, a Git repository, or a module registry. To use a module, you can call it from within another Terraform configuration file using the module block and passing any necessary variables. For example:

```arduino
module "compute_instance" {
  source = "./modules/compute_instance"

  instance_count = 3
  instance_type  = "n1-standard-1"
}

```

In this example, the `module` block references a module located in the `./modules/compute_instance` directory. It passes two variables, `instance_count` and `instance_type`, to the module.

Modules can also have input variables that can be set from the calling configuration file, and output variables that can be used in other parts of the configuration. Here is an example of a module with input and output variables:

```arduino
// In modules/compute_instance/main.tf

resource "google_compute_instance" "compute_instance" {
  count        = var.instance_count
  name         = "instance-${count.index}"
  machine_type = var.instance_type
  zone         = "us-central1-a"

  boot_disk {
    initialize_params {
      image = "debian-cloud/debian-9"
    }
  }
}

// In modules/compute_instance/variables.tf

variable "instance_count" {
  description = "Number of compute instances to create"
  type        = number
}

variable "instance_type" {
  description = "Instance type for the compute instance"
  type        = string
}

// In modules/compute_instance/outputs.tf

output "instance_ips" {
  value = google_compute_instance.compute_instance.*.network_interface.0.access_config.0.nat_ip
}

```

In this example, the `google_compute_instance` resource is defined with variables `instance_count` and `instance_type`. These variables are defined in the `variables.tf` file. The outputs.tf file defines an output variable `instance_ips` that returns the external IP addresses of the created instances.

Using modules in Terraform allows for better organization, reuse, and sharing of infrastructure code. It also makes it easier to maintain and update infrastructure components in a centralized way.

### Summary of Terraform commands

Terraform CLI (Command Line Interface) is a tool that provides a set of commands for managing and deploying infrastructure using Terraform. Here are some of the basic Terraform CLI commands:

1. `terraform init`: This command initializes a working directory containing Terraform configuration files. It downloads and installs the required providers and initializes the backend. Example:

```arduino
terraform init
```

2. `terraform plan`: This command generates an execution plan that shows what changes Terraform will make to the infrastructure. It compares the current state of the infrastructure with the desired state specified in the Terraform configuration files. Example:

```arduino
terraform plan
```

3. `terraform apply`: This command applies the changes to the infrastructure. It creates, updates, or destroys resources as necessary to match the desired state specified in the Terraform configuration files. Example:

```arduino
terraform apply
```

4. `terraform fmt`: This command formats the Terraform configuration files to follow the standard syntax and style guide. Example:

```arduino
terraform fmt
```

5. `terraform validate`: This command validates the Terraform configuration files for syntax errors and other issues. Example:

```arduino
terraform validate
```

6. `terraform state`: This command shows the current state of the infrastructure as recorded in the state file. It can also be used to modify the state file directly. Example:

```arduino
terraform state list
```

7. `terraform show`: This command shows the resources that Terraform created or updated. It displays the attributes and values of each resource. Example:

```arduino
terraform show
```

8. `terraform destroy`: This command destroys all the resources created by Terraform. Example:

```arduino
terraform destroy
```

9. `terraform version`: This command shows the version of Terraform that is installed. Example:

```arduino
terraform version
```

These are some of the basic Terraform CLI commands. There are many more commands and options available for managing and deploying infrastructure with Terraform. To learn more, you can refer to the Terraform documentation or run `terraform --help` to see a list of all the available commands.
