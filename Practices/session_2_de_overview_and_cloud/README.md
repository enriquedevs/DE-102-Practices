# Evolution of Data Engineering Pipelines with Cloud Computing

Let's explore the transformation of data engineering, from on-premises infrastructure to the cloud, and its impact on data warehouses, databases, data pipelines, and the rise of ELT.

In the past, data engineering revolved around on-premises solutions where organizations built and managed their own data centers. These data centers housed data warehouses and databases, serving as the backbone of data processing.

However, as technology advanced and data processing needs grew, scaling on-premises infrastructure became challenging. Organizations struggled to accommodate increasing data volumes and processing requirements, necessitating a new approach.

The emergence of cloud computing presented a transformative alternative. Cloud service providers offered virtually unlimited scalability, elasticity, and flexibility, allowing organizations to leverage these advantages.

Cloud-based data warehouses provided the ability to scale storage and compute resources on-demand. This scalability allowed data engineers to handle vast amounts of data seamlessly, accommodating fluctuating workloads without substantial upfront investments.

Cloud-based databases also underwent significant changes. Managed database services eliminated manual database administration tasks, offering high availability, automatic backups, and built-in replication. This shift reduced the burden on data engineers, enabling them to focus on extracting insights from the data.

In the on-premises world, data transformations occurred before loading data into the warehouse, resulting in delays and resource-intensive operations. However, the cloud's elasticity and computational power revolutionized this approach.

In the cloud era, data engineers could load raw, unprocessed data directly into cloud-based data warehouses. This change facilitated quick ingestion and storage of large volumes of data in its raw format. Data transformations and analysis could then be performed directly within the database using powerful distributed computing resources.

The cloud had a profound impact on modern data architecture, enabling the integration of diverse structured and unstructured data sources across organizations. Cloud-based storage services, such as object storage and data lakes, offered cost-effective options for storing and accessing massive volumes of raw data.

The shift to ELT provided multiple advantages. It reduced the time and effort required for data preprocessing, allowing data engineers to focus on extracting insights and value from the data. Moreover, it enabled agile and iterative data processing, allowing engineers to refine and adjust transformations as requirements emerged or data evolved.

Scalability and on-demand resource provisioning capabilities in the cloud transformed data engineering pipelines. Data engineers could dynamically scale resources based on workload requirements, efficiently handling varying data volumes and processing needs. This elasticity ensured pipelines could adapt to peak loads during high-demand periods and scale back during quieter periods, optimizing resource utilization and reducing costs.

The cloud also brought new possibilities for pipeline orchestration and automation. Cloud-based services and tools provided automation and orchestration capabilities, simplifying the design and management of complex workflows. Scheduling, dependency management, error handling, and monitoring became more efficient and reliable, ensuring streamlined execution of data engineering pipelines.

Additionally, the cloud's integration with various data services and tools expanded the horizons of data engineering pipelines. Data engineers gained access to a rich ecosystem of data processing, analytics, and machine learning services, leveraging specialized tools for specific tasks within the pipeline. This integration facilitated the seamless flow of data between services, enabling end-to-end data processing and analysis workflows.

In conclusion, the evolution from on-premises infrastructure to the cloud has revolutionized data engineering. The scalability, elasticity, and flexibility of the cloud have reshaped data warehouses, databases, and data pipelines. This shift, coupled with the emergence of ELT, has propelled modern data architecture into new frontiers. Data engineers now have the power to drive innovation, uncover valuable insights, and guide organizations on their data-driven journey.
